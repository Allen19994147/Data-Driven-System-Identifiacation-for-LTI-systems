# Data-Driven-System-Identifiacation-for-LTI-systems
In this repository, algorithms for system identification are developed and implemented for LTI systems.

In SysID, a full algorithm for LTI system identification can be found in the first section of the code. It supports system with any order and input & output dimensions, unknown initial condition and random inputs (to make sure it's persistency excitation). It also works for corrupted measurements or even nonlinear systems by capturing its linear dynamics to approximate. The second and
